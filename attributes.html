<h1>Attribute Groups</h1></font>

All attributes consist of a name and a value ;<br>
 the name reflects a property of
the element the attribute is describing,<br>
 and the value is a value for that property.
<br>
There are three groups of attributes that many of the XHTML elements can carry:
<br>
<ul type = disc>
<li>Core attributes: 
The class , id , and title attributes</li>

<li>Internationalization attributes: The dir , lang , and xml:lang attributes
</li>
<li>UI events: Attributes associated with events such as onclick , ondoubleclick , onmousedown ,
onmouseup , onmouseover , onmousemove , onmouseout , onkeypress , onkeydown , and
onkeyup .</li>
</ul>

<b>Together, the core attributes and the internationalization attributes are known as
universal attributes .</b>

<h3> Core Attributes</h3>
<h4>The four core attributes that can be used on the majority of XHTML elements (although not all) are:
</h4>
<b><i>id &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;title &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;class &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;style</i></b>
<h4>The id Attribute</h4>
The id attribute can be used to uniquely identify any element within a page.<br>
The syntax for the id attribute is as follows (where string is your chosen value for the attribute):<br>
id=” string ”
<br>For example, the id attribute could be used to distinguish between two paragraph elements, like so:
<br>
< p id=”accounts” ><br> This paragraph explains the role of the accounts
department. < /p ><br>
< p id=”sales” > This paragraph explains the role of the sales department. < /p ><br>
Note that there are some special rules for the value of the id attribute. <br>
It must:
<ul type = square>
<li>Begin with a letter (A – Z or a – z) and can then be followed by any number of letters, digits (0 – 9),
hyphens, underscores, colons, and periods (you may not start the value with a digit, hyphen,
underscore, colon, or period).</li>
<li>Remain unique within that document; no two id attributes may have the same value within one
XHTML page.</li>
</ul>
</body>
</html>
