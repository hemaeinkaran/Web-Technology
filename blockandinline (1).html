<h1>Block and Inline Elements</h1></font>

<h3>Block - level elements</h3><br>
<h4>Block - level elements appear on the screen as if they have a carriage return or line break before and after
them. <br>
For example, the < p > , < h1 > , < h2 > , < h3 > , < h4 > , < h5 > , < h6 > , < ul > , < ol > , < dl > , < pre > , < hr / > ,
< blockquote > , and < address > elements are all block - level elements. <br>They all start on their own new
lines, and anything that follows them appears on its own new line, too.</h4><br>

<h1> Block-Level Elements </h1>
<p> <strong> Block-level elements </strong> always start on a new line. The
<code> &lt;h1 &gt; </code> and <code> &lt;p &gt; </code> elements will not sit
on the same line, whereas the inline elements flow with the rest of the
text. </p>
<h3>Inline elements</h3><br>
<h4>Inline elements, on the other hand, can appear within sentences and do not have to appear on new lines
of their own. <br>The < b > , < i > , < u > , < em > , < strong > , < sup > , < sub > , < big > , < small > , < ins > , < del > ,
< code > ,<br> < cite > , < dfn > , < kbd > , and < var > elements are all inline elements.</h4><br>
